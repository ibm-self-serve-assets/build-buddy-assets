### **IBM watsonx Orchestrate Demo Script: The Daily Sales Reporter**

**Presenter:** [Your Name]
**Role:** Demo Specialist, IBM
**Duration:** 18 Minutes

---

### **Section 1: Introduction & The Modern Manager's Dilemma (3 Minutes)**

**(0:00 - 1:30) | Opening & Company Context**

**Presenter:** "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your time today. My name is [Your Name], and I’m a specialist here at IBM focused on helping businesses like yours transform their operations with AI-powered automation.

We're here today because we understand a fundamental challenge in modern business: your most valuable employees, your managers, are often bogged down by what we call the 'data tax.' They spend hours every week hunting for information, toggling between dashboards, and manually compiling reports, instead of doing what they do best: leading their teams and driving results.

Today, we’re going to show you a new way of working. We'll demonstrate how IBM watsonx Orchestrate can give every manager a personal digital assistant to handle these repetitive tasks, starting with one of the most common: the daily sales report."

**Key Messages:**
*   Acknowledge the audience's time and set the stage.
*   Frame the problem around a relatable pain point: the "data tax."
*   Introduce watsonx Orchestrate as the solution—a "digital assistant" for every employee.

**(1:30 - 3:00) | The Problem Statement: Report Roulette**

**Presenter:** "Let's get specific. Think about your sales managers. Every morning, they need to know what happened yesterday. The process today probably looks something like this:

1.  Log into the CRM.
2.  Log into the sales analytics dashboard.
3.  Log into the inventory system.
4.  Export data from each system—often into different formats.
5.  Manually consolidate it in a spreadsheet, calculate key metrics, and try to format it into something readable.

This process is not just time-consuming; it's prone to errors, leads to inconsistent reporting, and delivers insights hours after they were needed. Managers are making decisions based on stale, manually assembled data. What if they could get that report, accurately and instantly, just by asking a simple question in natural language?"

**Business Value Proposition:**
*   **Problem:** Manual reporting is slow, error-prone, and costly in terms of lost productivity.
*   **Impact:** Delays decision-making, reduces manager effectiveness, and introduces data inconsistency.
*   **Hook:** Tease the vision of instant, conversational access to critical business data.

### **Section 2: The Solution & Live Demonstration (8 Minutes)**

**(3:00 - 4:00) | Solution Overview: Your New Digital Teammate**

**Presenter:** "That's exactly what we've built with watsonx Orchestrate. We're going to introduce you to a new digital teammate we’ve created: the **'Daily Sales Reporter' agent**.

This agent is designed to do one thing exceptionally well: automate the entire sales reporting workflow. It has secure connections to your key data sources and is empowered by a large language model to understand context, execute tasks, and present information clearly.

Instead of logging into multiple systems, the manager simply talks to Orchestrate. Let's see it in action."

**Key Messages:**
*   Position the agent as a "digital teammate," not just a tool.
*   Emphasize its purpose-built nature and secure connectivity.
*   Transition smoothly into the live demo.

**(4:00 - 11:00) | Live Demo Flow**

**Presenter:** `[SWITCH SCREEN TO WATSONX ORCHESTRATE CHAT INTERFACE]`

"Okay, you're now looking at the watsonx Orchestrate interface. I'm playing the role of a busy sales manager starting my day. I need my numbers, fast."

**Demo Step 1: The Simple, Direct Request**

*   **Presenter:** "I'm not going to click any buttons or fill out any forms. I'm just going to ask a question in plain English."
*   **Action:** Type into the chat: `Get yesterday's sales report.`
*   **Presenter:** `[PAUSE as the agent works, typically a few seconds]` "Now, watch what happens. Orchestrate understands my intent. It recognizes that this task belongs to the 'Daily Sales Reporter' agent. The agent is now securely invoking its tools to connect to our sales data source, extract the key metrics, and format them."
*   **Expected Outcome:** A clean, formatted summary appears directly in the chat.
    ```
    **Yesterday's Sales Report (October 29, 2025):**

    *   **Total Revenue:** $152,340.55
    *   **Total Orders:** 847
    *   **Average Order Value:** $179.86
    *   **New Customers:** 62
    *   **Top 5 Selling Items:**
        1.  Quantum Laptop Pro
        2.  Cyber Office Chair
        3.  Fusion Wireless Mouse
        4.  HD Webcam 4K
        5.  Stealth Mechanical Keyboard
    ```
*   **Presenter:** "And there it is. In seconds, I have a complete, accurate summary. No spreadsheets, no dashboards, no wasted time."

**Demo Step 2: Conversational Follow-Up & Context Awareness**

*   **Presenter:** "But the real magic isn't just the first answer; it's the conversation. I don't need to start a new query. Orchestrate remembers the context of our discussion. Let's dig deeper."
*   **Action:** Type a follow-up question: `Interesting. Who was the top customer by revenue?`
*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent responds with a specific answer.
    ```
    The top customer by revenue yesterday was **Global Tech Inc.** with a total spend of $18,550.
    ```
*   **Presenter:** "Perfect. Notice I didn't have to say 'for yesterday' again. The agent understood the context. Now, let's refine the report."
*   **Action:** Type another follow-up: `Show me the top 3 products instead of 5.`
*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent provides a revised, shorter list.
    ```
    Of course. Here are the top 3 selling items:
    1.  Quantum Laptop Pro
    2.  Cyber Office Chair
    3.  Fusion Wireless Mouse
    ```
*   **Presenter:** "This demonstrates how Orchestrate isn't a rigid chatbot; it's a flexible AI assistant that adapts to my needs on the fly."

**Demo Step 3: Taking Proactive Action**

*   **Presenter:** "Getting data is one thing, but acting on it is what matters. This report looks great, and I want to share it with my team. Let's ask Orchestrate to do the work for me."
*   **Action:** Type a command that requires another skill: `This is great. Draft an email to the sales team with this summary and a note of congratulations.`
*   **Expected Outcome:** A pre-populated email draft appears, ready to be sent.
    ```
    **Subject:** Excellent Sales Performance for October 29th!

    **To:** sales-team@yourcompany.com

### **Section 3: How It Works & Business Impact (5 Minutes)**

**(11:00 - 13:00) | Technical Highlights: Under the Hood**

**Presenter:** `[SWITCH TO A SIMPLE ARCHITECTURE SLIDE OR SPEAK TO IT]`

"What you just saw looks like magic, but it's powered by a very deliberate and robust architecture. Let's quickly look at the three key components:"

1.  **The Agent (The Brain):** The 'Daily Sales Reporter' is a **Native Agent** we built using the watsonx Orchestrate ADK (Agent Development Kit). We gave it simple instructions in natural language, like 'You are an expert at creating sales reports. Use your tools to fetch and summarize data.' The agent uses an IBM Granite model on watsonx to reason, understand intent, and decide which tools to use.

2.  **The Tools (The Hands):** The agent itself doesn't store data. It uses a set of secure, pre-authorized tools. For this demo, these are simple Python functions that could easily be API calls to your real systems.
    *   `get_sales_data(date)`: Connects to a sales database or CRM API.
    *   `summarize_metrics(data)`: Performs calculations on the raw data.
    *   `draft_email(summary)`: Integrates with an email service like Outlook or Gmail.

3.  **The Platform (The Engine):** The watsonx Orchestrate platform handles everything else: the secure connections to your enterprise systems, the user interface, the conversational memory, and the orchestration of the AI models and tools.

**Technical Value Proposition:**
*   **Composable & Scalable:** Build agents for any task by combining different tools.
*   **Secure by Design:** Tools run with pre-defined permissions, respecting your existing data governance.
*   **Open & Flexible:** Connect to anything with an API or build custom logic with Python.

**(13:00 - 16:00) | Business Impact & ROI**

**Presenter:** "Let's bring this back to business value. What does this mean for your organization?"

*   **Time Savings & Productivity Gain:**
    *   Imagine giving back **30-60 minutes per day** to every sales manager. Across 50 managers, that's over 100 hours of high-value time reclaimed *every week*. That’s time they can now spend coaching their reps, talking to customers, and closing deals.

*   **Improved Decision-Making:**
    *   Managers get instant access to accurate, real-time data. They can spot trends faster, address issues proactively, and make data-driven decisions with confidence.

*   **Enhanced Employee Experience:**
    *   You're removing a tedious, low-value part of their job. This boosts morale and allows your best people to focus on what they were hired to do, not on manual data entry.

*   **Scalability & Consistency:**
    *   Every manager gets the same, accurate report every time. The 'Daily Sales Reporter' never has a bad day, never makes a calculation error, and is available 24/7. As you hire more managers, your digital workforce scales instantly.

**ROI Statement:**
"By automating routine data tasks, watsonx Orchestrate delivers a clear return on investment by amplifying the productivity of your most critical employees, accelerating your business intelligence, and fostering a more efficient, data-driven culture."

### **Section 4: Q&A and Next Steps (2 Minutes)**

**(16:00 - 18:00) | Q&A Preparation**

**Presenter:** "That concludes the formal demonstration. I'd now be happy to answer any questions you may have."

*   **Anticipated Question 1: How does this connect to our specific systems (e.g., Salesforce, SAP)?**
    *   **Answer:** "Great question. Orchestrate connects to systems primarily through APIs. If your system has a REST API, we can build a tool to interact with it. We use the OpenAPI standard for seamless integration. For custom logic or systems without APIs, we can use Python tools, like we did in this demo, to create custom connections."

*   **Anticipated Question 2: What about data security and permissions?**
    *   **Answer:** "Security is paramount. The agent itself doesn't store your data. It operates on a principle of least privilege. The tools it uses are configured with specific credentials and permissions that you control. So, the agent can only see and do what its underlying service accounts are explicitly allowed to, respecting all your existing security policies."

*   **Anticipated Question 3: How difficult is it to build a new agent like this?**
    *   **Answer:** "It's designed to be accessible. Our Agent Development Kit (ADK) allows your builders—whether they are pro-code developers or technical business analysts—to define agents using simple YAML files and Python. You define the agent's instructions in plain English and then connect it to the tools it needs. We can stand up a new agent for a well-defined use case like this in a matter of days, not months."

**(18:00 - 18:00+) | Next Steps & Call to Action**

**Presenter:** "Thank you again for your time and your excellent questions. The 'Daily Sales Reporter' is just one example of what's possible.

As a next step, we would love to schedule a **Discovery Workshop** with your team. In that session, we can identify your top 3-5 high-value, high-frequency tasks that are prime candidates for automation with watsonx Orchestrate. From there, we can build a tailored proof of concept that solves a real problem for your business.

My colleague [Account Manager Name] will follow up to find a time that works for you. We're excited about the possibility of partnering with you on this journey."
