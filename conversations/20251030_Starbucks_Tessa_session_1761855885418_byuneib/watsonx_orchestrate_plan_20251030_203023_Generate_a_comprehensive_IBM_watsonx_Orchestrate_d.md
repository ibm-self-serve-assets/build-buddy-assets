# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: Financial Compliance Automation for Global Finance Corp

## Overview
This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for building a watsonx Orchestrate demo tailored for **Global Finance Corp (GFC)**. The client's primary challenge is the manual, time-consuming, and error-prone process of generating quarterly financial compliance reports. This process involves aggregating transaction data, performing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks, analyzing for risks, and compiling a detailed report for auditors.

This demo will construct a sophisticated multi-agent system that automates the entire compliance workflow. The solution features a top-level **`compliance_supervisor_agent`** that intelligently delegates tasks to specialized collaborator agents: a **`data_harvester_agent`** for data collection, a **`risk_analysis_agent`** for threat detection, and a **`report_generator_agent`** for final document creation. This will showcase how watsonx Orchestrate can transform complex business processes, improve accuracy, reduce operational costs, and ensure regulatory adherence for GFC. This plan is a complete, end-to-end implementation, addressing all components required for a successful demonstration.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure the following are installed and configured on your system. This setup is crucial for developing, importing, and testing the agents and tools.

1.  **Python 3.8 or higher**: The watsonx Orchestrate ADK is a Python library. Ensure a compatible version of Python is installed and accessible from your command line.
2.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK)**: This is the core toolkit for building and managing Orchestrate assets. Install it via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
3.  **watsonx Orchestrate CLI configured**: You must have the CLI configured to connect to your watsonx Orchestrate instance. This typically involves running `orchestrate login` and providing your credentials.
4.  **A Text Editor or IDE**: A tool like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text is recommended for writing Python code and YAML configuration files.

## Step 1: Project Setup and Directory Structure
A well-organized project structure is essential for managing the different components of the solution. Create the following folder structure in your workspace. This isolates agents, tools, and dependencies, making the project scalable and easy to navigate.

```
gfc_compliance_demo/
├── agents/
│   ├── 01_data_harvester_agent.yaml
│   ├── 02_risk_analysis_agent.yaml
│   ├── 03_report_generator_agent.yaml
│   └── 04_compliance_supervisor_agent.yaml
├── tools/
│   ├── data_collection_tools.py
│   ├── risk_analysis_tools.py
│   └── report_generation_tools.py
└── requirements.txt
```

Create the `requirements.txt` file. For this demo, no external libraries are needed, but it is a best practice to include it for future expansion.
```text
# requirements.txt
# No external packages are required for this specific set of synthetic data tools.
# If tools were to call external APIs, packages like 'requests' would be listed here.
```

## Step 2: Create Python Tools with Synthetic Data
The foundation of our agents' capabilities lies in the tools they can use. We will create three Python files, each containing a set of related tools that generate realistic, synthetic financial data. This approach allows for a powerful demo without requiring live integration into GFC's systems.

### 2.1 Data Collection Tools (`tools/data_collection_tools.py`)
These tools are responsible for gathering the raw data needed for the compliance analysis. They simulate fetching information from various internal financial systems, such as transaction databases and CRM platforms.

**Business Value:** This demonstrates Orchestrate's ability to act as a central data aggregation point, breaking down data silos and providing a unified view of customer activity for holistic risk assessment. It automates the most tedious and error-prone part of the process: manual data gathering.

```python
# tools/data_collection_tools.py

import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import uuid

from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="fetch_transaction_data", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def fetch_transaction_data(start_date: str, end_date: str, region: str) -> str:
    """
    Fetches financial transaction data for a specified date range and region. This tool simulates querying a core banking system to retrieve all relevant transactions for a compliance period.

    Args:
        start_date (str): The start date for the data query in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.
        end_date (str): The end date for the data query in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.
        region (str): The geographic region to filter transactions (e.g., 'NA', 'EMEA', 'APAC').

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string representing a list of 15 to 20 transaction records.
    """
    transactions = []
    for _ in range(random.randint(15, 20)):
        transactions.append({
            "transaction_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
            "timestamp": (datetime.strptime(start_date, "%Y-%m-%d") + timedelta(days=random.randint(0, 90))).isoformat(),
            "amount": round(random.uniform(100.0, 50000.0), 2),
            "currency": "USD",
            "source_account": f"ACC{random.randint(10000, 99999)}",
            "destination_account": f"ACC{random.randint(10000, 99999)}",
            "transaction_type": random.choice(["WIRE", "ACH", "INTERNAL_TRANSFER"]),
            "region": region,
            "status": "COMPLETED"
        })
    return json.dumps(transactions, indent=2)


@tool(name="fetch_customer_profiles", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def fetch_customer_profiles(account_ids: list[str]) -> str:
    """
    Retrieves customer profile information for a given list of account IDs. This simulates querying a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to enrich transaction data with customer context, which is vital for risk assessment.

    Args:
        account_ids (list[str]): A list of account IDs to fetch profiles for.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string representing a dictionary of customer profiles, keyed by account ID.
    """
    profiles = {}
    unique_account_ids = list(set(account_ids))
    for acc_id in unique_account_ids:
        profiles[acc_id] = {
            "customer_id": f"CUST{random.randint(1000, 9999)}",
            "entity_type": random.choice(["INDIVIDUAL", "CORPORATE"]),
            "risk_rating": random.choice(["LOW", "MEDIUM", "HIGH"]),
            "onboarding_date": (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=random.randint(365, 1825))).strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
            "country_of_residence": random.choice(["USA", "UK", "SG", "CH"])
        }
    return json.dumps(profiles, indent=2)
```

### 2.2 Risk Analysis Tools (`tools/risk_analysis_tools.py`)
These tools perform the core compliance logic. They analyze the collected data to identify potential risks, such as transactions involving sanctioned entities or behavior that deviates from normal patterns.

**Business Value:** This is the heart of the automation, showcasing how Orchestrate can execute complex analytical tasks consistently and at scale. It significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of risk detection compared to manual reviews, reducing the risk of costly compliance failures.

```python
# tools/risk_analysis_tools.py

import json
import random
from datetime import datetime
import uuid

from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="screen_transactions_aml", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def screen_transactions_aml(transactions_json: str) -> str:
    """
    Screens a list of transactions against a mock Anti-Money Laundering (AML) watchlist. This simulates integration with a third-party or internal screening service to identify high-risk activities.

    Args:
        transactions_json (str): A JSON string containing a list of transaction objects.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string with screening results, including a list of flagged transactions and the reason for each flag.
    """
    transactions = json.loads(transactions_json)
    flagged_transactions = []
    watchlist = [f"ACC{random.randint(30000, 30100)}" for _ in range(5)] # Mock watchlist
    
    for i, txn in enumerate(transactions):
        # Flag 10-20% of transactions for demonstration purposes
        if i % random.randint(5, 10) == 0:
             flagged_transactions.append({
                "transaction_id": txn["transaction_id"],
                "flag_reason": "Matched Sanctions Watchlist",
                "watchlist_match": random.choice(watchlist),
                "severity": "CRITICAL"
            })
    
    return json.dumps({"flagged_transactions": flagged_transactions}, indent=2)

@tool(name="analyze_transaction_patterns", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def analyze_transaction_patterns(transactions_json: str) -> str:
    """
    Analyzes transaction data for anomalous patterns such as structuring or unusual fund flows. This tool simulates a sophisticated risk engine that detects suspicious behavior not caught by simple watchlist screening.

    Args:
        transactions_json (str): A JSON string containing a list of transaction objects.

    Returns:
        str
