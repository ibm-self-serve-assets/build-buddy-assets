# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: Empower Agent for Employee Success

## Overview
This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to building and deploying an advanced, multi-agent solution on IBM watsonx Orchestrate. The solution, named "Empower," is designed to serve as a sophisticated digital assistant for your employees, streamlining access to HR, benefits, and IT support information. By orchestrating multiple specialized agents and tools, the Empower agent will act as a central point of contact, intelligently routing employee queries to the correct resource, whether it's looking up healthcare providers, checking the status of an IT ticket, or finding answers in the company's knowledge base.

This demo addresses the common business challenge of fragmented employee support systems, where information is scattered across different platforms like ServiceNow, benefits portals, and internal FAQs. The Empower agent unifies these systems, providing a seamless, conversational experience that reduces administrative overhead, improves employee satisfaction, and ensures consistent, accurate responses. This plan will guide you through creating the necessary tools, knowledge bases, and agents, culminating in a powerful, production-ready digital assistant tailored to your organization's needs.

## Prerequisites
Before beginning, ensure your environment is correctly set up. This is crucial for a smooth development and deployment process.

1.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate Account**: You need an active watsonx Orchestrate account with access to the Agent Builder.
2.  **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**: The ADK must be installed and configured on your local machine. This includes the `orchestrate` CLI. If you haven't installed it, run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade "ibm-watsonx-orchestrate[adk]"
    ```
3.  **Python Environment**: A working Python environment (version 3.10 or later) is required to create the custom tools. You should have `pip` available for installing packages.
4.  **ADK Environment Initialization**: You must have an active watsonx Orchestrate environment configured in your ADK. Initialize and activate it using the following commands:
    ```bash
    # Log in to your IBM Cloud account
    orchestrate login

    # Initialize your environment (follow the prompts)
    orchestrate env init

    # Activate the environment you created
    orchestrate env use <your_env_name>
    ```
5.  **Project Directory Structure**: To keep the project organized, create the following directory structure. This plan will reference these paths.
    ```
    empower_demo/
    ├── agents/
    │   ├── customer_care_agent.yaml
    │   ├── service_now_agent.yaml
    │   └── empower_agent.yaml
    ├── tools/
    │   ├── customer_care/
    │   │   ├── get_healthcare_benefits.py
    │   │   ├── get_my_claims.py
    │   │   └── search_healthcare_providers.py
    │   └── service_now/
    │       ├── create_service_now_incident.py
    │       ├── get_my_service_now_incidents.py
    │       └── get_service_now_incident_by_number.py
    ├── knowledge/
    │   ├── faqs/
    │   │   └── employee_faq.pdf
    │   └── employee_knowledge_base.yaml
    └── requirements.txt
    ```
6.  **Dummy Knowledge Base Document**: Create a simple PDF document named `employee_faq.pdf` inside the `empower_demo/knowledge/faqs/` directory. Add sample Q&A content like:
    *   "What is the company's remote work policy?"
    *   "How do I request vacation time?"
    *   "What are the guidelines for expense reports?"

## Step 1: Create Python Tools
Tools are the foundational components that perform specific actions. We will create two sets of tools: one for customer care (benefits, claims) and another for IT support (ServiceNow incidents).

### 1.1 Customer Care Tools

#### `get_healthcare_benefits.py`
**Business Value**: This tool provides employees with immediate, self-service access to detailed information about their healthcare plans. It eliminates the need to manually search through complex benefits documents or contact HR for common questions, saving time for both employees and the HR department. By offering clear comparisons between plans, it empowers employees to make informed decisions about their healthcare coverage.

**Technical Implementation**: This Python tool uses the `requests` library to call an external mock API that returns benefits data. It defines a Pydantic `Enum` to enforce valid inputs for the `plan` argument, ensuring data integrity. The function is decorated with `@tool` to make it discoverable by Orchestrate agents, and includes error handling for API call failures.

Create the file `empower_demo/tools/customer_care/get_healthcare_benefits.py`:
```python
# empower_demo/tools/customer_care/get_healthcare_benefits.py
from enum import Enum
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission
import requests

class Plan(str, Enum):
    HDHP = 'HDHP'
    HDHP_Plus = 'HDHP Plus'
    PPO = 'PPO'

@tool(permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def get_healthcare_benefits(plan: Plan, in_network: bool = None):
    """Retrieves a comprehensive list of health benefits data, organized by coverage type and plan variant.

    This data includes details such as annual deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums, and various co-pays or
    percentages for medical services under different network plans (HDHP, HDHP Plus, and PPO).

    Args:
        plan (str, optional): The plan the user is currently on. Can be one of "HDHP", "HDHP Plus", or "PPO".
            If not provided, all plans will be returned.
        in_network (bool, optional): Whether the user wants coverage for in-network or out-of-network.
            If not provided, both will be returned.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains plan coverage details.
    """
    try:
        resp = requests.get(
            'https://get-benefits-data.1sqnxi8zv3dh.us-east.codeengine.appdomain.cloud/',
            params={
                'plan': plan.value,
                'in_network': in_network
            }
        )
        resp.raise_for_status()
        return resp.json()['benefits']
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return f"Error fetching healthcare benefits: {e}"
```

#### `get_my_claims.py`
**Business Value**: This tool gives employees instant visibility into the status of their medical claims. It reduces anxiety and uncertainty associated with the claims process and decreases the volume of status-check inquiries to the HR/benefits team. Employees can quickly see processed, pending, or rejected claims, including reasons for rejection, allowing them to take necessary follow-up actions promptly.

**Technical Implementation**: This tool simulates fetching user-specific claims data by returning a hardcoded list of realistic claim dictionaries. In a real-world scenario, this would connect to a secure internal API. The data includes varied statuses, dates, and financial details to provide a comprehensive and realistic demo experience. The `@tool` decorator exposes this function to the Orchestrate platform.

Create the file `empower_demo/tools/customer_care/get_my_claims.py`:
```python
# empower_demo/tools/customer_care/get_my_claims.py
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool

@tool
def get_my_claims() -> list[dict]:
    """Retrieves detailed information about the current user's submitted medical claims.

    The details include claim status, submission and processing dates, amounts claimed and approved,
    provider information, and services included in the claims.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: A list of dictionaries, each containing details about a specific claim.
    """
    claims_data = [
        {
            "claimId": "CLM1234567",
            "submittedDate": "2024-05-15",
            "claimStatus": "Processed",
            "processedDate": "2024-05-25",
            "amountClaimed": 150.00,
            "amountApproved": 120.00,
            "provider": "Healthcare Clinic ABC",
            "services": [{"description": "General Consultation", "dateOfService": "2024-05-10"}]
        },
        {
            "claimId": "CLM7654321",
            "submittedDate": "2024-06-01",
            "claimStatus": "Pending",
            "processedDate": None,
            "amountClaimed": 300.00,
            "amountApproved": None,
            "provider": "City Health Hospital",
            "services": [{"description": "X-ray Imaging", "dateOfService": "2024-05-28"}]
        },
        {
            "claimId": "CLM9876543",
            "submittedDate": "2024-06-05",
            "claimStatus": "Rejected",
            "processedDate": "2024-06-10",
            "amountClaimed": 200.00,
            "amountApproved": 0.00,
            "rejectionReason": "Service not covered by policy",
            "provider": "Downtown Diagnostics",
            "services": [{"description": "MRI Scan", "dateOfService": "2024-06
