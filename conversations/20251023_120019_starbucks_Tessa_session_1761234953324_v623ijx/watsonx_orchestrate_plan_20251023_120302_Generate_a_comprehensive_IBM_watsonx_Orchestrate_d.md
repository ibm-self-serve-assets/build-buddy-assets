# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: Financial Compliance Automation

## Overview
This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for building and deploying a sophisticated multi-agent automation solution for a large financial institution using IBM watsonx Orchestrate. The primary objective is to address the client's challenge of manual, time-consuming, and error-prone processes for financial transaction analysis, compliance verification, and executive reporting.

The proposed solution implements a hierarchical agent architecture, where a `supervisor_agent` orchestrates a series of specialized collaborator agents to perform complex tasks. This digital labor force will automate the end-to-end workflow: collecting raw transaction data, processing it for risk metrics, performing rigorous Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance checks, and finally, generating insightful, formatted reports for management. This plan leverages the IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK) to create custom Python-based tools and declarative YAML-based agents, delivering a robust, scalable, and auditable automation pattern tailored to the financial services domain.

## Prerequisites
Before beginning the implementation, ensure your development environment is correctly configured. This is crucial for a smooth development and deployment process.

1.  **Python Environment**: An installation of Python 3.9 or higher is required. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit is the core command-line tool for this project. Install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
3.  **Text Editor/IDE**: A code editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or PyCharm is recommended for editing Python and YAML files.
4.  **Terminal/Command Prompt**: You will need access to a terminal or command prompt to execute the `orchestrate` CLI commands for importing tools and agents.
5.  **watsonx Orchestrate Environment**: You must have access to an active IBM watsonx Orchestrate environment (SaaS or Developer Edition) and have it configured with the ADK CLI.

## Step 1: Project Setup and Directory Structure
A well-organized project structure is essential for managing the various components of your watsonx Orchestrate solution. Create the following directory structure in your local development environment. This separation of concerns makes the project easier to navigate, maintain, and scale.

```
/financial_automation_demo
|-- /agents
|   |-- 01_data_processing_agent.yaml
|   |-- 02_compliance_agent.yaml
|   |-- 03_reporting_agent.yaml
|   |-- 04_supervisor_agent.yaml
|-- /tools
|   |-- data_processing_tools.py
|   |-- compliance_tools.py
|   |-- reporting_tools.py
|-- requirements.txt
```
*   **/agents**: This directory will contain the YAML configuration files for each of the four agents. The numbered prefix helps indicate the import order.
*   **/tools**: This directory will house the Python files, with each file containing the functions for a specific set of tools.
*   **requirements.txt**: This file will list all necessary Python package dependencies for your tools.

## Step 2: Create Python Tools
The tools are the functional building blocks of your agents, performing the actual work. Each tool is a Python function decorated with `@tool`, containing realistic synthetic data generation to simulate interactions with enterprise systems.

### 2.1 Data Processing Tools
These tools are responsible for collecting raw data and transforming it into a structured, usable format for analysis. They form the foundation of the automation workflow by ensuring data quality and consistency.

**File:** `tools/data_processing_tools.py`

```python
import json
import random
