## Step 2: Create the Agent Tools

Tools are the functional building blocks of agents, allowing them to interact with external systems and perform actions. We will create six distinct Python-based tools, three for customer care and three for ServiceNow, each populated with realistic synthetic data.

### 2.1 Customer Care Tools

These tools empower the `customer_care_agent` to answer questions about healthcare plans, claims, and providers.

#### `get_healthcare_benefits.py`

*   **Business Value**: This tool provides employees with on-demand access to detailed health plan information, enabling them to compare plans and understand their coverage without needing to contact HR. This self-service capability is crucial during open enrollment or when employees have questions about specific medical procedures.
*   **Technical Implementation**: The Python function uses Pydantic models for structured input (`Plan` Enum) and returns a filtered list of benefits from a comprehensive synthetic dataset. It simulates calling an internal benefits API.
