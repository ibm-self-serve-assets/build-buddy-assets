# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: End-to-End Business Process Automation

## Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for creating a powerful IBM watsonx Orchestrate demo tailored for a client in the **Logistics and Supply Chain** domain. The demo will showcase an end-to-end automation of a core business process: **Sales Order Processing and Fulfillment**. This addresses the client's key challenges of manual processing, high error rates, lack of real-time visibility, and compliance risks.

We will construct a multi-agent architecture where a supervisor agent orchestrates several specialized collaborator agents to handle distinct stages of the workflow: order validation, inventory management, customer compliance, logistics, and business analytics. This pattern demonstrates how watsonx Orchestrate can serve as a "digital labor" force, integrating disparate tasks into a seamless, intelligent, and automated business process.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your environment is set up with the following components. This setup is crucial for developing, importing, and testing the agents and tools.

1.  **Python Environment**: A working installation of Python (version 3.9 or higher) is required to create the custom tools.
2.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit (ADK) must be installed. This provides the necessary libraries and command-line interface (CLI) to build and manage Orchestrate assets.
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
3.  **watsonx Orchestrate Environment**: You must have access to an active watsonx Orchestrate environment and be logged in via the CLI.
    ```bash
    orchestrate login
    ```
4.  **Project Directory**: Create a dedicated folder structure to organize your files. This is a best practice for managing complex projects.
    ```bash
    mkdir orchestrate-logistics-demo
    cd orchestrate-logistics-demo
    mkdir agents
    mkdir tools
    ```
5.  **Text Editor/IDE**: A code editor like Visual Studio Code is recommended for editing Python and YAML files.

## Step 1: Create Python Tools for Business Automation

Our automation relies on a set of custom tools that perform specific business functions by simulating interactions with various enterprise systems (ERP, CRM, Compliance DB). Each tool is a Python function decorated with `@tool` and includes a detailed docstring that Orchestrate uses to understand its purpose, inputs, and outputs.

### 1.1. Order Processing Tools

These tools handle the initial validation and inventory checking for new sales orders, simulating interactions with an Order Management System or ERP.

**Business Value:** Automating these initial steps reduces manual data entry errors, provides immediate feedback on order feasibility, and prevents downstream issues caused by incorrect data or stockouts.

**File:** `tools/order_processing_tools.py`

```python
# tools/order_processing_tools.py
import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def validate_order_data(order_id: str, customer_id: str, items: list) -> str:
    """
    Validates the structure and completeness of incoming sales order data.

    This tool simulates checking an order against business rules, such as ensuring all required fields
    (order_id, customer_id, items) are present and correctly formatted. It is the first quality gate in the
    order processing workflow.

    Args:
        order_id (str): The unique identifier for the sales order.
        customer_id (str): The unique identifier for the customer.
        items (list): A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains 'sku' and 'quantity'.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string indicating validation status, a message, and the validated data.
    """
    if not all([order_id, customer_id, items]):
        return json.dumps({"status": "Failed", "message": "Validation Error: Missing required order data."})
    if not isinstance(items, list) or len(items) == 0:
        return json.dumps({"status": "Failed", "message": "Validation Error: Items list cannot be empty."})
    for item in items:
        if 'sku' not in item or 'quantity' not in item:
            return json.dumps({"status": "Failed", "message": "Validation Error: Each item must have a 'sku' and 'quantity'."})
        if not isinstance(item['quantity'], int) or item['quantity'] <= 0:
            return json.dumps({"status": "Failed", "message": f"Validation Error: Quantity for SKU {item['sku']} must be a positive integer."})

    return json.dumps({
        "status": "Success",
        "message": "Order data is valid and well-formed.",
        "validated_order": {"order_id": order_id, "customer_id": customer_id, "items": items}
    })

@tool(permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def check_inventory_levels(items: list) -> str:
    """
    Checks the availability of stock for items in a sales order.

    This tool simulates a real-time query to an inventory management system. It checks if the requested
    quantity for each product SKU is available in the warehouse. This is critical for confirming an order
    and providing accurate fulfillment estimates.

    Args:
        items (list): A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains 'sku' and 'quantity'.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string detailing the stock availability for each item and an overall status.
    """
    # Synthetic inventory data: In a real scenario, this would be an API call.
    inventory_db = {
        "PROD-123": {"name": "Industrial Widget A", "stock": 150, "location": "WH-A"},
        "PROD-456": {"name": "Industrial Widget B", "stock": 80, "location": "WH-B"},
        "PROD-789": {"name": "Industrial Component C", "stock": 0, "location": "WH-A"},
        "PROD-101": {"name": "Industrial Gadget D", "stock": 500, "location": "WH-C"},
    }
    
    availability_report = []
    all_items_available = True
    for item in items:
        sku = item['sku']
        quantity_needed = item['quantity']
        stock_info = inventory_db.get(sku)

        if stock_info and stock_info["stock"] >= quantity_needed:
            availability_report.append({
                "sku": sku,
                "status": "In Stock",
                "available": stock_info["stock"],
                "requested": quantity_needed,
                "location": stock_info["location"]
            })
        else:
            all_items_available = False
            availability_report.append({
                "sku": sku,
                "status": "Out of Stock" if not stock_info or stock_info["stock"] == 0 else "Insufficient Stock",
                "available": stock_info["stock"] if stock_info else 0,
                "requested": quantity_needed,
                "location": stock_info["location"] if stock_info else "N/A"
            })
    
    overall_status = "Available" if all_items_available else "Partial or No Availability"
    return json.dumps({"overall_status": overall_status, "details": availability_report})
```

### 1.2. Customer and Compliance Tools

These tools perform due diligence by verifying customer information and screening against compliance watchlists, simulating interactions with a CRM and a regulatory database.

**Business Value:** Automating compliance checks is critical for mitigating regulatory risk, avoiding fines, and ensuring the business operates within legal frameworks. It transforms a slow, manual process into an instant, auditable step in the workflow.

**File:** `tools/customer_compliance_tools.py`

```python
# tools/customer_compliance_tools.py
import json
import random
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def verify_customer_details(customer_id: str) -> str:
    """
    Verifies customer details and checks their account status.

    This tool simulates querying a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to retrieve customer
    information and confirm their account is in good standing (e.g., credit status, active account).
    This step is essential before proceeding with fulfillment.

    Args:
        customer_id (str): The unique identifier for the customer.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string with the verification status and customer data.
    """
    # Synthetic customer database
    customer_db = {
        "CUST-8876": {"name": "Global Manufacturing Co.", "status": "Active", "credit_ok": True, "tier": "Gold"},
        "CUST-1234": {"name": "Regional Distributors", "status": "Active", "credit_ok": True, "tier": "Silver"},
        "CUST-5678": {"name": "New Ventures LLC", "status": "On Hold", "credit_ok": False, "tier": "Bronze"},
    }
